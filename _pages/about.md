I am an assistant professor in the [Programming Languages Group](https://pl.ewi.tudelft.nl) at [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl). Before moving to [TU Delft](https://www.tudelft.nl), I was an assistant professor at the [Computer Science Department](https://www.cse.iitd.ernet.in) at [IIT Delhi](https://home.iitd.ac.in). Previously, I have worked at various industrial R&D positions at [AMD](https://www.amd.com/), [TCS Research](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tata_Research_Development_and_Design_Centre), and [IBM Research](http://www.research.ibm.com/labs/india/).

My research interests are programming languages, compilers, and verification with a focus on concurrency and weak memory consistency models.
